# Part-IB-Expectation-IDyOM

Everything one needs to get started using IDyOM for the first time. No setup, no faff, just expectation modelling!

## Getting Started

The purpose of this repository is to make it as simple as possible to use IDyOM, a statistical learning model for musical expectation (Pearce, 2005). 

This repository holds all the code needed to produce what is essentially a virtual machine that will run everything for us. It relies on a GitHub service called Codespaces. A codespace is a container that will take care of all the setup we need to get going with IDyOM.

Clicking the below button will take you to a page to initialise the container. Simply click the 'Create codespace' button and wait for it to spin up! You will need to have an account on GitHub to do this - these are free and easy to create.

Setup can take a while, so please be patient. You'll know when it's done, as a bunch of new things will appear on your screen!

- Once the setup is complete, click onto [idyom.ipynb](idyom.ipynb), which is a notebook we can run code from. 
- When we try to run some code, we will be asked whether we want to install/enable suggested extensions Python + Jupyter. Go ahead and enable these.
- We then need to select a kernel, this is what will run our code. Click on `Python Environments`, then `Python 3.12.11 usr/local/bin/python`.

That's all of our setup done!
